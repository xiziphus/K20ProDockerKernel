# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a Docker-enabled kernel for the Redmi K20 Pro (raphael) Android device. The goal is to create a custom Android kernel that supports running Linux containers (Docker, Podman, etc.) and enables cross-architecture container migration from x86 to ARM64. The kernel must include all necessary configurations for container runtime support, cgroup management, networking, and security features required by Docker.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to build a Docker-enabled kernel for K20 Pro, so that I can run Linux containers natively on the Android device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the kernel is compiled THEN it SHALL include all Docker-required kernel configurations
2. WHEN the kernel boots THEN it SHALL support container namespaces (PID, NET, IPC, UTS, USER)
3. WHEN Docker daemon starts THEN it SHALL have access to all required cgroup subsystems
4. WHEN containers are created THEN they SHALL have proper isolation and resource management

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the kernel to support container networking, so that containers can communicate with each other and external networks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers are started THEN they SHALL have network connectivity
2. WHEN bridge networking is used THEN containers SHALL communicate with each other
3. WHEN port mapping is configured THEN external traffic SHALL reach container services
4. WHEN iptables rules are applied THEN network filtering SHALL work correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the kernel to support container storage, so that containers can persist data and use overlay filesystems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers use volumes THEN data SHALL persist across container restarts
2. WHEN overlay filesystem is used THEN container layers SHALL be properly managed
3. WHEN bind mounts are created THEN host directories SHALL be accessible from containers
4. WHEN storage drivers are used THEN they SHALL provide efficient layer management

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the kernel to support cgroup resource management, so that containers can be properly isolated and resource-limited.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cgroup subsystems are mounted THEN all required controllers SHALL be available
2. WHEN container resource limits are set THEN they SHALL be enforced by the kernel
3. WHEN cpuset configuration is applied THEN CPU affinity SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN memory limits are set THEN containers SHALL not exceed allocated memory

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the kernel to support checkpoint/restore functionality, so that containers can be migrated across architectures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CRIU is used THEN container state SHALL be captured successfully
2. WHEN container is restored THEN it SHALL continue from the checkpointed state
3. WHEN cross-architecture migration occurs THEN containers SHALL run on the target platform
4. WHEN migration completes THEN application state SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the kernel build process to be automated and reproducible, so that the same kernel can be built consistently across different platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN kernel configuration is applied THEN it SHALL use the provided defconfig
2. WHEN kernel patches are applied THEN they SHALL modify the source correctly
3. WHEN kernel is compiled THEN it SHALL produce a bootable image
4. WHEN build process runs THEN it SHALL be reproducible across different environments
5. WHEN build tools are missing THEN the system SHALL automatically install required dependencies
6. WHEN building on macOS THEN binutils and cross-compilation tools SHALL be properly configured
7. WHEN building on Linux THEN native and cross-compilation binutils SHALL be available

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the kernel to integrate with Android's existing systems, so that Docker functionality doesn't break Android features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Android boots with the new kernel THEN all Android services SHALL function normally
2. WHEN Docker daemon runs THEN it SHALL coexist with Android's container management
3. WHEN SELinux policies are applied THEN they SHALL allow necessary Docker operations
4. WHEN system resources are used THEN Android and Docker SHALL share them appropriately

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive build tool verification and setup, so that all required dependencies are properly installed and configured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN binutils installation is checked THEN all required ELF tools SHALL be available
2. WHEN cross-compilation tools are verified THEN ARM64 toolchain SHALL be functional
3. WHEN ELF headers are searched THEN they SHALL be found in standard or NDK locations
4. WHEN build environment is validated THEN all dependencies SHALL be confirmed working
